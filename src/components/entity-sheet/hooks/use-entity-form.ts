 * PATCH) — no network call. Shared by objects now; processes/templates reuse the same builders.
 *
 * File uploads attach AFTER the entity write: io2p requires an upload to target an existing entity, so
 * once the object is committed we resolve each pending pick's target and `files.upload(blob, target)`.
 * References author inline in the body. A failed upload does NOT roll back the (already-saved) entity —
 * it toasts; the file simply isn't attached (visible on the next reload as absent).
 *
 * A failed ENTITY WRITE is different: nothing was committed, so the draft is left untouched and dirty
 * for the user to retry or copy out of. The two failures are caught separately on purpose — sharing one
 * handler would skip the post-save reset after a mere upload failure and pretend the save didn't happen.
