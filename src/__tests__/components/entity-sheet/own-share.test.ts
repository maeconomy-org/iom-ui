/**
 * The own/below split, and the multiplier resolution it has to mirror.
 *
 * The node scales each contributor by another property on its own object before summing.
 * Subtracting an UNSCALED own value from a SCALED total is the arithmetic bug these cover: it
 * reports a difference that is not there, on an object that may have nothing below it at all.
 *
 * `ownFactor` deliberately mirrors the node's four outcomes rather than simplifying them. Only an
 * ABSENT multiplier may default to one; the rest are present-but-unreadable, and defaulting those
 * would sum a contributor unscaled — the exact wrongness the feature exists to prevent.
