/**
 * R4 — a process shared WITH you names the objects inside it, which are not yours.
 *
 * The direction is the case. `hierarchy.spec.ts` shares from the primary account outward; here the
 * second account owns everything and the primary is the grantee, because the hazard only exists on
 * the reading side: a process's flow rows resolve their `ref` through an objects read, and the node
 * defaults objects to `scope: 'mine'`. Every object in a shared process belongs to the SHARER, so
 * `mine` drops all of them and the grantee gets flow rows pointing at nothing — a process that
 * renders, with inputs and outputs that are blank.
 *
 * That failure is quiet in the way this suite keeps finding: the sheet opens, the tabs are there,
 * the counts on the list row are right, and only the names are missing. Asserting the tab or the
 * row would pass through it, so the assertion is the object's NAME inside the flow row.
 *
 * DESTRUCTIVE to the shared session — it signs in as the second account to create and share, so it
 * owes an unconditional `restoreSession`. The teardown also deletes what it made, and it has to do
 * that AS the second account, which is why the hook switches twice and ends in a `finally`.
