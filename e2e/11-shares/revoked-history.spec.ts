/**
 * S9 — who USED to have access, and the rule that decides when they stop being listed.
 *
 * `73ec00d` added the history, guarded by `if (live.has(key)) continue`. This case drives both
 * DIRECTIONS of that guard on ONE subject through ONE source: revoke and they appear in the history;
 * restore and they leave it, because a live grant now covers the same key. A history that kept
 * listing a person sitting in the members list above is the failure the commit message names, and a
 * count-only assertion would miss it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER: the `source` half of the key. `live` is keyed by
 * `${keyOf(subject)}::${shareId ?? 'direct'}`, and the reason source is in there is that a live
 * Share-sourced grant must NOT hide a revoked direct one — "and only that one". Everything below
 * would pass identically against a projection keyed by subject alone, because one subject with one
 * source cannot tell them apart. Covering it needs the same person holding a live Share-sourced
 * grant beside a revoked direct one, which is fixture work this case does not do.
 *
 * No session switch: account 2 is only ever a SUBJECT here, never signed in, so this file owes no
 * `restoreSession`.
