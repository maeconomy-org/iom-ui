 *
 * A rollup rule matches `search.k` EXACTLY — core lowercases the key and does nothing else — so an
 * import that spelled a column `mass_1` where the typed property field writes `mass-1` produced
 * rows no rule could ever sum. Nothing failed: the objects imported, the rule saved, the values
 * were visible in both sheets, and the total was simply absent. The two halves had no test that
 * ever met, which is why the divergence survived being written down as a contract.
 *
 * So the header below is deliberately MULTI-WORD: the separator is the thing under test, and a
 * single-word key would pass under either spelling.
